===============

Sketches and supporting code for my jeenode sensors work

This is some simple code to run on Jeenodes to make them into simple generic temperature sensors using DHT22 or one-wire DS18B20 sensors.

All data is transmitted using a simple ascii protocol, making debuging using terminal tools easy.

## Depenencies

* OneWire library (source TBC)
* DallasTemperature library (source TBC)
* JeeLib
* DHT library (source TBC)
